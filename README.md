# Assignment_6-Object-Oriented-Programming

Purpose
The purpose of this program is to practice using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to represent real-world data.  
This project focuses on creating `Customer` objects from a loan dataset and displaying each record’s details clearly in the terminal.

 What the Program Does
 Defines a **`Customer` class** with attributes:
 `customer_id`
 `name`
 `loan_amount`
 `interest_rate`
 `term_months`
 `status`
- Reads loan records from **`LoansDataset.csv`** without using external libraries like *pandas* or *csv*.
- Creates and stores a list of `Customer` objects.
- Prints each customer’s details in a formatted way.
- Displays the total number of successfully parsed customers.
