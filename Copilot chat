need a Python program that creates a Customer class and builds objects from a data file. Do not use pandas or the csv module, only basic file reading and string splitting.  The class should be called Customer and include the following attributes: customer_id, name, loan_amount, interest_rate, term_months, and status. Include an init method that stores these values and a str method that prints the customer information in a clear way. Then write a function that opens the data file, reads each line, splits the line into parts, creates a Customer object for each line, stores them in a list, and prints each customer as well as the total number of customers at the end.
